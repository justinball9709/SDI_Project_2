<p> Hello I made a change </p>
<p>The theme I decided to pick was someone working in the wireless industry. I used another name for the person but I am actually
telling my story of my life. I actually work for a Verizon retailer and I wanted to share that in my story. I always enjoyed selling
phones so I decided to use this example as my theme. I'm very passionate about it and thought it would be nice to put it into code.</p>
<p>My theme is very simple and I am telling a story about someone in the wireless industry.</p>
